# Data Structures and Algorithms

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

The expected size of the data, how the data relates to one another, what operations you need to perform with the data, and how frequently do you need to perform each operation.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

We must have a base case (also known as a base condition), which should be at the top of the recursive function's body so that it is evaluated before anything else in the . We must also check to make sure that the base case will eventually evaluate as true. Otherwise, it the base condition will be incorrect, still never get evaluated, and still result in an infinite recursive call.
