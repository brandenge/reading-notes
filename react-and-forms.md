# React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

## The Ternary Operator Explained

### Why would we use a ternary operator?

1. If you want to shorten your if/else statement into a single line of code.
2. If your want your if/else statement to return a value, so that it can be saved to variable or returned from a function, for example.

### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

Rewrite:
```
console.log(x === y ? true : false);
```
