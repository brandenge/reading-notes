# JavaScript Frameworks

## Gatsby and Next.js

### Teach us two things about Next.js.

1) Next.js is a JavaScript web framework built on top of React.
2) Next.js is full-stack, giving React applications backend features, such as server-side rendering (SSR).
3) Next.js solves many common problems with React, such as search engine optimization, and even further improved performance.

### Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.

1) Gatsby is also a JavaScript framework built on top of React.
2) Gatsby is opinionated about using GraphQL for data fetching.
3) Gatsby has a plugin ecosystem.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

Just increasing my familiarity with all the different JavaScript frameworks, what makes them different, how you might choose to use one in a project, and also which ones I might be especially interested to learn in the future.
