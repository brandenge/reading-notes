# NODE.JS

## An Introducftion to NODE.JS

### What is node.js?

A JavaScript runtime that executes locally on the computer. It extends and modifies Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine to run on the computer more directly, rather than within the web browser. For example, the console.log() method in Node logs out to standard output in the terminal, rather than in the browser.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a JavaScript runtime that runs in the Chrome web browser. So it executes within the web browser application itself, rather than more directly on the computer and operating system that the web browser runs on top of.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

It means that it provides the environment for JavaScript code to execute in. Kind of like its execution context. This means it has a core library and standard library that can be used to extend JavaScript itself.

### What is npm?

This is the package manager for Node.js. It has a database of packages (i.e. libraries, etc.) that can be downloaded, and it helps manage those packages and their respective versions.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?

v18.7.0

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

8.16.0

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install -g jshint

### What is node used for?

For running JavaScript on the server, or locally on your computer, outside of the browser.

## Pair Programming

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from each other
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness 

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Learning from each other. Every developers has different strengths and weaknesses. Pair programming helps to teach where you are stronger than your partner, and learn from them where you are weaker.

### How does pair programming work?

Programmers pair up, with one driver and one navigator. The driver has their hands on the keyboard and types the code. They are more focused on the syntax. The navigator is observing the driver, thinking about solutions, higher-level about design, and conducting research when needed. If both programmers get stuck, they can both switch to researching. Both programmers are constantly communicating throughout.
