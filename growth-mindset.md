# Growth Mindset

This topic is relevant because software development as a profession leverages a growth mindset possibly more than almost any other profession. It is among the fastest-paced, and largest in terms of quantity of knowledge and skills needed in the field. Furthermore, imposter syndrome is a common problem in the field. This makes grit and growth mindsets fundamental skills for software developers.

### Deliberate Practice

Deliberate practice is the concept that attempts to emphasize why some people can go many years or even decades continuing to practice or get more experience with a particular skill and never significantly improve any further. Many people hit a plateau that they will never surpass for the rest of their lives. And the reason is that although they may be practicing, their practice is not deliberate.

Deliberate practice is different in that it requires you to be stretching your abilities. Your practice must be at a sweet spot in terms of difficulty - not too difficult that it cannot be done, but also not too easy (which can sometimes be called mass practice). Basically, you should try to push your practice to be as difficult as possible while still being productive and valuable as a learning experience.

Because deliberate practice requires significant difficulty, it also requires significant focus. So it is this combination of difficulty and focus together to get as much as possible out of the experience and grow from it.

### Growth Mindset

Research shows a dichotomy between growth mindsets vs fixed mindsets that develops early in childhood and often lasts throughout adulthood for many people.

People with growth mindsets are:
- Thrilled by challenges, viewing them as an opportunity to grow.
- Focus on process over outcomes.
- Are not afraid of failure.
- Believe that intelligence is dynamic, not static.
- Rewarded for their effort, not their intelligence.

### Grit

- Grit can be briefly defined as "passion and perseverance for long-term goals" (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Duckworth)).
- Grit is also like resilience.
- Grit is one of the biggest factors that predicts success and happiness in people, according to research.

### Redefining success

- We need to redefine failure. Many times failures are massive learning lessons and the pre-requisite for eventual success.
- We need to stop taking the common, outward definitions of success from other people and society at large, and spend more time defining what success means for ourselves individually at a personal level.
- We should be less judgmental of others' perceived failures and/or successes.
