# Engineering Readings

These readings are relevant for teaching what is a good engineering mindset, what is a good approach to problem solving, and how to become a better problem-solver more generally. All of these topics are fundamental to any engineering field.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

The combination of my unique and diverse set of experiences. This includes my background as a Marine Corps veteran, my business education, my experience as a writer and as a gamer. Also my unique and diverse life goals, including education goals, family goals, and entrepreneurial goals. These experiences and goals give me a very powerful personal understanding of the reasons for why I want to become a great software engineer, which is fuel that will continue to drive me for a very long time.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Talk outloud my understanding of the problem (i.e. rubber duck debugging).
2. Google search to get other ideas and other possibly relevant information.
3. Take a break from the problem and come back to it later.
