# React Notes

## What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

They are 2 separate libraries. React provides the core functionality which is a user interface library that generates raw user interface components and is agnostic to how those components are used/consumed. React being agnostic allows it to work in many different environments.

ReactDOM provides the functionality and methods for React that are specific to the DOM, such as rendering to the DOM. ReactDOM consumes the raw components which are generated by React. There are many other similar libraries as well that provide platform-specific functionality for React, such as React 360 for rendering React components in 3d environments and virtual reality. Each of these additional React-interfacing libraries are what allows React to run in their respective specific runtime environment. 

Note that it is important to understand the difference between the two as React elements are not DOM elements. React elements are just native JavaScript objects. React elements are transformed into DOM elements by the ReactDOM library. Also there are generally more things you can do with React elements than with DOM elements.

Is React a framework or a library?

React is considered a library, not a framework. The difference is that frameworks usually have a lot of helper functions and impose a certain way for how everything has to be organized. React is more lightweight, less opinionated, and has less constraints than a traditional framework such as Angular would have.
