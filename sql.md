### Relational Databases

Relational databases are described as "relational" because they structure data into two-dimensional tables (like spreadsheets) that can then be related to other tables to link (or relate) data together. This then allows for powerful queries and other operations to be performed on the data. It also allows for data structures of any type, not just hierarchical structures as non-relational databases are confined to using. Relational databases are based on the field of relational algebra in mathematics.

Tables are related to one another in a relational database by matching a primary key in one table, which identically matches a foreign key in another table. Through different types of uses of primary keys and foreign keys, tables are able to have either one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.
