# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

This topic matters is relevant to Code Fellows because Code Fellows is itself a diverse school and learning environment. The company itself is diverse, and also the students we are learning with are diverse.

### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The popularization and mass production of affordable personal computers at home. This started around 1984. And it was mostly marketed towards boys.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Besides getting more obvious experience and interest just by playing with/using them as kids, they became more ready to identify with being a sophisticated user of computers, and popular culture further reinforced that identity.

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

When the company's leaders at the very top make it a priority and commit to it.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

People with diverse backgrounds bring a greater number of different ideas with them, so there is a greater selection from the pool of ideas in any creative or innovative process, which makes it more likely to pick better ideas, leading to better outcomes.

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

A diverse company will be able to better relate to a wider number of different backgrounds with its users. For example, increasing engagement in various minority groups. Or bring ideas of how their product might be used a different way. For example, using a mobile application left-handed.

A diverse user base can also serve a diverse company by giving a community a more balanced, welcoming culture.
