## Ethics in the Workplace

[The code I'm still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

A powerful and concise story about how software can be used for immoral business purposes that cause harm, even deaths, and the regret of the developers involved. The author was very candid and real about his responsibility and lack of concern at the time of working on the unethical project. This was a very refreshing and deep self-reflection that is rarely seen.

Although I understand the author's regret, I think he should forgive himself at some point, especially by the good that publishing his article has clearly done and will continue to do. He was young at the time, and none of us can fully understand the way the world works and the moral implications of our actions at a young age.

I also have some moral regrets in my life, both inside and outside of the tech industry. But I too was young, and now I know better. Not making mistakes is an impossible goal. So the most imoprtant thing is to deeply reflecting on the lessons of our mistakes to learn from them, not making them again, and to further prevent anyone else from making them. This article achieves all of that. None of us can be solely responsible for our own actions. Our environment shapes us. And our environment, society, and the world at large fails us just as much (if not more so) as we may fail ourselves.

Although there are legitimate ethical concerns about the influence of technology on any social issue, I find the one regarding influencing democratic systems, even to the point of them falling apart, to be the least convincing and concerning. We have already had massive negative influences on democracies for the last 60-70 years with the advent of the television and the internet and its ability to spread misinformation and propaganda, under the veil of truthful, trustworthy, and authoritative sources. And misinformation and propaganda existed long before technology. The most horrible examples of abusive totalitarian regimes that led to more murder and death than ever before in human history by far - Hitler's Nazi Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong's Communist China, all existed well before the advent of modern techonology. All they had was mass-print and radio to influence their citizenry. And yet all those regimes still failed spectacularly.

The reason for this is simple. As technology becomes more advanced and powerful in its ability to influence us, we too also adapt and improve our understanding for how it influences us. I would argue that the mass-print and radio propaganda of the early 20th century was far more potent than the technologically-driven propaganda of the modern era today. And the reason is simple: what is more important than how powerful the information delivery system is, is how prone a population is to believe anything. And people today have gotten to the point where they don't trust any information - hence the term 'fake news' is now common in popular culture. Of course, that can sometimes be a ruse superficially label any information that is inconsistent or inconvenient to one's beliefs. But regardless, skepticism has clearly increased in proportion with the advancements of technology as well.

All of this is also well defended against with relatively simple and effective education about the influences of technology. Which such technology also makes it easier to educate the populations of a society as such. So technology seems to have somewhat of a self-balancing effect on its ability to influence human beliefs and behavior.

Now it is very plausible that technology leads to the end of democratic systems, but not necessarily in the way that is always discussed and thought about. Instead, there could come about a new political paradigm for governing societies which is the next evolutionary step for human civilization. Humanity first started tribal, then totalitarian (the era of god-kings and emperors), then authoritarian (monarchies, lordships, then modern authoritarianism - a transitionary phase towards democracy), and now democratic now today. Except our democratic systems today are not actually pure democracies. They are either republican/congressional democracies or parliamentary democracies - neither of which are actually true democracies. So technology might push us towards either the next evolution of democracy - a more pure form of democracy, or indeed towards something more different altogether - such as a meritocracy. After all, it isn't necessarily well-advised to rule countries based purely on popularity contests. If that were true, then we should model or governments like high school. And so there is no guarantee that democracy is even the most ethical or competant way to govern a society.
